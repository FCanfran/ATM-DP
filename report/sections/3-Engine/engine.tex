\textcolor{red}{\textbf{TODO: Switch the description, edge and event channel merged in 1 single channel}}\\

Description of the channels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{event}: events channel. \textcolor{red}{TODO: Describe the type of events!}
    \item \texttt{alert}: direct channel from the filters (in particular the filter worker) to the sink (it does not go through the Generator, although it has it to be able to give it to the filters so that they are able to write on it)
    \item \texttt{out\_event}: direct dedicated event channel between Generator and Sink.
    \item \texttt{internal\_edge}: edge channel between filter and its worker. Used to communicate to the worker the edges belonging to the filter that the worker needs to process. \textcolor{red}{$\rightarrow$ Now events and not only edges, and also distinguishing between start and end edges on the type of event.}
    \item \texttt{endchan}: synchronization channel between Filter and Worker, to let Filter know whenever Worker is done. To avoid finishing the filter before the worker is actually done. \textcolor{red}{TODO: Include in the drawing}
  \end{itemize}

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Problem detected}\\
If the EOF event is sent through the event channel then it can happen that this event reaches / is treated before the full stream of edges is fully read / processed, leading to
the termination of the processes before the processing of all the edges.\\
Therefore, we decide to merge the edge and the event channel in one single channel!}

Some notes on the implementation decisions:

\subsection{Filter worker}

Options:

\begin{itemize}
  \item External (named) goroutine
  \item \textcolor{green}{$\rightarrow$} Internal anonymous goroutine
\end{itemize}

Advantages of this decision:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Code simplification, the filter worker can access the variables of the scope of the
  filter (no need to pass them as parameters). This is particularly useful in the case of the \texttt{alert} channel, to which the worker is able to write directly. Same in the case of the \texttt{internal\_edge} channel.
\end{itemize}

and in the case of passing the edges of the card from the filter to the filter worker:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Shared buffer using mutex
  \item \textcolor{green}{$\rightarrow$} Channel 
\end{itemize}

In the case of having a shared buffer to communicate the edges between the filter and the worker a mutex is needed. This is because the filter and the worker can possible write and read, respectively, into this buffer at the same time. With it we will avoid race conditions in the sharing of the buffer. However, a channel or other kind of tool would be needed to indicate the worker that there is an edge ready to be read in the buffer. Not having this, would imply to continuosly have the worker requesting the mutex to read from the buffer, even when it is empty and there is no edge to read. 

Therefore as a much more simple alternative, we decided to use an internal channel \texttt{internal\_edge} in between the filter and the worker. With it we avoid having to use a mutex and leading with its derived coordination issues. As a general use case channels are typically used for \emph{passing the ownership of data} which is the case we are dealing with.

\section{Multiple cards per filter support}

Use a hash table to index card ids to card subgraphs
\begin{itemize}
  \item key: card id
  \item value: pointer to Graph
\end{itemize}

Note that golang maps are inherently dynamic in size. -> control the desired maximum size by ourselves. 

Management:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Filter
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Reads to check the existance of an entry on the map
    \item Creates the entries on the map (in the corresponding cases)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Worker
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Modifies the entries on the map once they are created
    (Filter does not modify values after the creation of the entry)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Conclusion: Safe to do it with a single map and without mutex, since
there can not be concurrent writes on the same map entries. Filter writes
on the creation and then it is only the worker who writes on that entry after
the creation of the entry by the filter.

\textcolor{red}{Issue: "fatal error: concurrent map read and map write"}

More details -- in Golang it is not defined what happens when we have simultaneous read/write operations:

  \item \href{https://go.dev/doc/go1.6}{Runtime. Use of maps}

  \item \href{https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts/c/_XHqFejikBg?pli=1}{Golang maps concurrency - blog}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution}

2 hash tables (to avoid race conditions in concurrent access by filter \& worker):
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{cardList}: to control the belonging cards to the filter. Only access by filter.
  \item \texttt{cardSubgraph}: to map each belonging card to its corresponding subgraph. Only access by worker.
\end{itemize}

Note that, all the edges that we pass to the worker are of cards that belong to the corresponding filter. This means that we do not need to do any check on the \texttt{cardSubgraph} map.
