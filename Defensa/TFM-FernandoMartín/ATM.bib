abstract = {The Internet is built on top of intertwined network services, e.g., email, DNS, and content distribution networks operated by private or governmental organizations. Recent events have shown that these organizations may, knowingly or unknowingly, be part of global-scale security incidents including state-sponsored mass surveillance programs and large-scale DDoS attacks. For example, in March 2015 the Great Cannon attack has shown that an Internet service provider can weaponize millions of Web browsers and turn them into DDoS bots by injecting malicious JavaScript code into transiting TCP connections.While attack techniques and root cause vulnerabilities are routinely studied, we still lack models and algorithms to study the intricate dependencies between services and providers, reason on their abuse, and assess the attack impact. To close this gap, we present a technique that models services, providers, and dependencies as a property graph. Moreover, we present a taint-style propagation-based technique to query the model, and present an evaluation of our framework on the top 100k Alexa domains.},

abstract = {With the prevalence of graph data in a variety of domains, there is an increasing need for a language to query and manipulate graphs with heterogeneous attributes and structures. We propose a query language for graph databases that supports arbitrary attributes on nodes, edges, and graphs. In this language, graphs are the basic unit of information and each query manipulates one or more collections of graphs. To allow for flexible compositions of graph structures, we extend the notion of formal languages from strings to the graph domain. We present a graph algebra extended from the relational algebra in which the selection operator is generalized to graph pattern matching and a composition operator is introduced for rewriting matched graphs. Then, we investigate access methods of the selection operator. Pattern matching over large graphs is challenging due to the NP-completeness of subgraph isomorphism. We address this by a combination of techniques: use of neighborhood subgraphs and profiles, joint reduction of the search space, and optimization of the search order. Experimental results on real and synthetic large graphs demonstrate that our graph specific optimizations outperform an SQL-based implementation by orders of magnitude.},
